        <h1>Memory Game (C# Windows Forms)</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Memory Game</strong> is a simple yet engaging game that challenges players to match tiles based on different difficulty levels. Built using <strong>C# Windows Forms</strong>, the game provides an interactive way for users to test their memory and concentration skills.  
            <br><br>
            <strong>Game Concept:</strong> 
            The game consists of various tiles that are initially hidden. The objective is to reveal and match pairs of tiles based on the selected difficulty level.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Key Features:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Easy Level:</strong> Players are presented with colored tiles. The goal is to match pairs of tiles with the same color. Players are given a limited number of tries, and if the counter reaches zero, the player loses.</li>
              <li><strong>Medium Level:</strong> This level uses numbered tiles instead of colors. The objective remains the same: match pairs of tiles with the same number within the given number of tries.</li>
              <li><strong>Hard Level:</strong> The hardest level involves matching photos. Players must match identical images, making the game more challenging as it requires sharper focus and a better memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>Game Mechanics:</strong>
            Each level includes a try counter, which tracks the number of attempts the player has made. If the counter reaches zero before all pairs are matched, the player loses the game. The player must strategize and remember tile locations to succeed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Technology Used:</strong> The game is developed using C# and Windows Forms, providing a simple yet effective environment for game development and interaction.
            <br><br>
            The <strong>Memory Game</strong> is designed to challenge and improve the player’s memory while offering a fun and rewarding experience with three difficulty levels that cater to different skill levels.
